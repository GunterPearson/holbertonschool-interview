This repository contains projects that help build self confidence in interview skills and keys to successful interviewing. Working through these projects I have gained a greater understanding of essential data structures (Hash Tables, Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Pointers, etc.), along with Recursion, Sorting Algorithms, and Time Complexity.


## Programming Languages
- Python
